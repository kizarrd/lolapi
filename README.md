 - the maximum matchlist range allowed for one query is 100
    - e.g. if you played tf for 431 games, then you need to execute 5 queries in total to cover all 431 games. (0-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, 400-432)
    - lol api matchlist index range seems it doesn't count the endIndex.
        - which means that if startIndex(beginIndex): 0 and endIndex: 100, then it actually shows the list from 0 to 99, excluding the 100. 
        - so if you want a list of 100 matches from 0 to 99, then you need to input 0 for startIndex(beginIndex) and 100 for the endIndex.
