# ideas
 - milliseconds to date gogo
 - winrate with friends? 
    - e.g. 
        - what's your account? 
        - what's your friend's account? 
        - what's the winrate when you play with this friend?
- namtat.gg
    - worst, best allies when you play mid/top/jg/ad/sup
    - worst, best enemies "
- monster.gg (괴물쥐쥐)

# Questions & Problems
1. can I res.render an html file? (instead of using pug as view engine)
2. when using fetch, summoner name is included in url. the problem is, if the name is in korean, error occurs. 
    - ==> URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set, so the problem occurs because korean characters are converted into ASCII format.
    - use encodeURI() function?

 - the maximum matchlist range allowed for one query is 100
    - e.g. if you played tf for 431 games, then you need to execute 5 queries in total to cover all 431 games. (0-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, 400-432)
    - lol api matchlist index range seems it doesn't count the endIndex.
        - which means that if startIndex(beginIndex): 0 and endIndex: 100, then it actually shows the list from 0 to 99, excluding the 100. 
        - so if you want a list of 100 matches from 0 to 99, then you need to input 0 for startIndex(beginIndex) and 100 for the endIndex. 


# algorithm
1. get username from the user. (search)
2. get encrypted accountId
3. use the id to get matchlists for 156 champions
    - save the matchlists info of the user.
    - in js array of objects format 
    - e.g. userMatchlists = [ 
        { 
            id: 4, 
            played: true, 
            matchIdList: [343543, 344354, 13241, 45324, ... ], 
        },
        { id: 266, played: no, matchIdList: [], ... },
        ...
        {}
    ]
4. analyze and calculate played-champions records & winrates and save them
    - e.g.
    - userRecords_championsPlayed: [
        {
            id: 4,
            numOfTimesPlayed: 431,
            encounterList:
                [
                    {
                        id: 266,
                        played: true,
                        playedAgainst: 15,
                        playedWith: 21,
                        winAgainst: 6,
                        winWith: 11
                        winRateAgainst: 0.4,
                        winRateWith: 0.5238095238
                    },
                    {
                        id: 2,
                        ...
                    },
                    ...
                ]
        },
        {
            id: 91, 
            numOfTimesPlayed: 124,
            encounterList: [...]
        },
        ...
      ]
5.  show it to user (render on website)
